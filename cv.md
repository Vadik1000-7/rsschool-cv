## About me:

#### Before I met Rsschool, I couldn't decide what I wanted to do. I understood different languages and spent a lot of time on it, thanks to this school I finally decided

#### I realized that I wanted to develop Frontend, The path was not easy, it was very difficult for me to start even with markdown markup. After the preparatory course, I became much stronger in my knowledge and desire to develop further.

#### I devote a lot of time to programming, 10% theory and 90% practice, there are aspirations and motives for learning new technologies, thanks to programming I am developing very well and more and more my self-confidence is disappearing :D.

#### I believe that I can achieve a lot thanks to my development, how hard I work on myself and I believe that everything I study will be very useful to me in life, especially the device in an it-company.

#### I believe that I will become a professional developer very soon.

## Code example:

### **Tribonacci Sequence KATA from CODEWARS**: *Well met with Fibonacci bigger brother, AKA Tribonacci.*
*As the name may already reveal, it works basically like a Fibonacci, but summing the last 3 (instead of 2)numbers of the sequence*
*togenerate the next. And, worse part of it, regrettably I won't get to hear non-native Italian speakers trying to pronounce it.*
```
function tribonacci(signature,n) {
  const result = signature.slice(0, n);
  while (result.length < n) {
    result[result.length] = result.slice(-3).reduce((p,c) => p + c, 0);
  }
  return result;
}
